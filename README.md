# Final-Project
**Project Purpose:**
The development of virtual reality has ignored the feelings of disabled groups, such as the DEAF, who do not enjoy the full viewing experience and lose a large part of their immersion because they cannot hear the music.
Horror movies and scary games, for example, are usually much less frightening when the sound is turned off. Therefore how to make it possible for deaf people to join in the enjoyment of virtual reality is also an important issue, so that the horror effect can be realized through the sense of touch instead of music.

## Project Timeline and Milestones
## Summer work plan
### Literature reading (3 weeks)

Providing feasible support for your project based on existing articles/techniques.

**Completed:** 
1. The substitutability of auditory experiences for the blind
2. Existing substitutes (tactile, visual)
3. Several modes of tactile stimulation (vibration, pressure, heat)
4. Differences in emotions conveyed by different modes of tactile modalities

**Unfinished:**
1. The effect of music on the atmosphere of a movie, the rhythmic melody of different types of music (scary music, exciting music)
2. Papers related to wearable device design (for design)

### Questionnaire
1. Does Haptics Have an Impact on Augmented Film/Virtual Reality Immersion (Yes, No)
2. If there were wearable devices that enabled vibration delivery, would people prefer one body part, or multiple? (1,2,3)
3. Does the sensation of touch vary from one body part to another? (Yes, No)
4. The parts of the body that are considered to be the most sensitive for sensing touch are (head, fingers, hand, arm, leg)

### Trying to extract audio
1. **Find a short play suitable for the exhibition**

   3-4 minutes in length and with a clear change of plot (different kinds of atmospheric music shaping).
2. **Plantfrom: aubio**
