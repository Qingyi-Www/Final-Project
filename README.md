# Final-Project
**Project Purpose:**
The development of virtual reality has ignored the feelings of disabled groups, such as the DEAF, who do not enjoy the full viewing experience and lose a large part of their immersion because they cannot hear the music.
Horror movies and scary games, for example, are usually much less frightening when the sound is turned off. Therefore how to make it possible for deaf people to join in the enjoyment of virtual reality is also an important issue, so that the horror effect can be realized through the sense of touch instead of music.
