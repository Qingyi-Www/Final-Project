# Final-Project
**Project Purpose:**
The development of virtual reality/movie/game has ignored the feelings of disabled groups, such as the DEAF, who do not enjoy the full viewing experience and lose a large part of their immersion because they cannot hear the music.

For example, horror movies are usually much less frightening when the sound is turned off. Therefore how to make it possible for deaf people to join in the enjoyment of virtual reality/movies is also an important issue. 

Therefore, I want to make a wearable device that increases deaf people's immersion in virtual reality/movies/games through touch instead of music. My goal is not to make music audible to the deaf, but to increase the viewing experience for the blind by replacing the sense of hearing with the sense of touch

**Inspiration:** Music: Not Impossible


## Project Timeline and Milestones
## Summer work plan
### Literature reading (3 weeks)

Providing feasible support for your project based on existing articles/techniques.

Academic Paper: View Literature Review.pdf 

**Completed:** 
1. Research：
  
   I. The substitutability of auditory experiences for the deaf

   II. Existing substitutes (tactile, visual)
   
2. Wrote the Introduction part of the essay: Literature Review.pdf

About the feasibility of my project, mainly including the existing research and the significance of the project. (see Essay part)

There’s the link about my essay on Google Docs if I upload a pdf that's not easy to read: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-iiLT-GF5E35Y-toC7YNKWTx89TsdeicaAzzfK-SBGA/edit?usp=sharing

3. Interview

I. I interviewed eight students around me with the questions in the questionnaire and I summarised each question. (see Summary and Transcript part)

Based on the interview questionnaire, I decided to design the vibration and squeeze sensors as two separate wearable devices to be worn on different parts of the user's body while watching the film (the exact position will be decided after I convert the audio into vibration).

II. The equipment needs to be rented from the school: Display, Headset, Table, Chair
In this case, it will be divided into four main viewing states, the first is to wear headphones to watch, the second is to wear wear wearable devices without headphones, the third is to wear no headphones without wearable devices to watch, and finally is to wear at the same time





**Unfinished:**
1. Papers related to wearable device design (for design)

### Questionnaire (half week, 7.10-7.25)

**Result:** View Summary & Transcript of the interview.pdf

### Extract audio (1/1.5 week, 7.25-8.10)

**1. Find a short play suitable for the exhibition**

   short film：controller
   
   link：https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_osh7dQa5lA

   Synopsis： Just before turning in for the night, Sarah soon finds her evening much more entertaining than anticipated. Surely cause and effect is the rational judgement? Or perhaps there is a far more whimsical reason? begging the question, who or what is the controller?
   
   3 minutes in length and with a clear change of plot, and the music in this film is very useful and switches more frequently (e.g. sound level, type of music), which I think is a better length for the final graduation exhibition.

   The music in this film almost has the sound effect (sound from TV) but lacks music that expresses emotions. But I think that this short film without music will affect the understanding of the film, so I think that this short film can still highlight what my project is presenting

   Question: The music is quoted in the film, so can I just note the creator and source of the music?
I contacted the director and he said I could use his video, I'm a little unsure, if I use his film, what part should I quote? Like does the school have citation format requirements? Or do I just need to ask the director to follow what he needs to present (at the end of the film and in the thesis? Because his original video is in Youtube and the video is not labelled with the director, should I re-edit it?)

### Different sensor tests (7.27-8.24)
Tests with different sensors, choose the 2-3 most suitable solutions.

**Vibration:**
1. Arduino Vibration Motor (SKU:RB-02S087): pure vibration, can control the time and interval of vibration (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/165207514)
2. LilyPad Vibe Board: Can be sewn into projects with conductive thread and controlled by a LilyPad Arduino (https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-) Lilypad-Slipper-Automatic-Foot-Massager/)
3. vr grip

**Squeeze:**
1. Servo motor drives the material belt spindle to rotate

2. Something like the Electronic Sphygmomanometer

### Design (8.25-9.4)
Sketch of 1 or 3 body part wearables based on questionnaire results (with three types of sensors, assembled into one wearable or separately based on questionnaire results)

## Autumn work plan
### Music data converted to tactile
Based on the conclusions of the pre-paper readings, the music in the film was transformed into a haptic experience through different tactile modalities and frequencies. (Will also be partially completed during **Different sensor tests** phases)

### Assemble
Assembling them after successful tests.
